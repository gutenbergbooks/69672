<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p>The Summers series of Readers consists of a Primer, a First
Reader, and a Second Reader, closely articulated for the purpose of
teaching beginners to read, and a Manual of Instruction intended
to give teachers a full knowledge of the elements involved in the
process of learning to read, and definite, practical guidance for daily
classroom work.</p>

<p>The whole purpose and essence of reading is the communication
of ideas. It is the thought—the impression—rather than the
form—the expression—which gives value to what is read. With
this fact in mind the subject-matter has been chosen with special
reference to primal social activities in history and contemporaneous
society significant of the race development, as the securing of food,
shelter, and clothing. But this subject-matter must touch the child
personally if it is to be of value in learning to read. It must appear
for him in the form of action, rhythm, stories, observation, plays
and games, if the symbols of reading are to be fraught with meaning
for him. What is of interest to the child, and what is of value
to society, have both been kept in mind in selecting and arranging
the literature of childhood used in this series of readers.</p>

<p>This Manual of Instruction provides for three half years of work.
Foreign children, or those of slower development, will require a
longer time. In that event, the lessons in the Manual will suggest
the <i>order</i>, not the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>In learning to read, two lines of work are to be developed at
separate periods each day. Reading lessons and Phonic lessons in
orderly sequence are given in the Manual of Instruction.</p>

<p>Helpful suggestions for this series of readers have come from
many sources. The author wishes to acknowledge especial indebtedness
to Edgar Dubs Shimer, Ph.D., District Superintendent, New
York City, for valuable criticism; to Grant Karr, Ph.D., Teacher of
the Principles of Education and Director of Observation in the
Training School for Teachers, New York City, for suggestions concerning
the statement of the unity of language; to Miss Alice H.
Damon, A.B., Supervising Principal of the Primary Department,
State Normal School, Potsdam, N. Y., for assistance in preparing
the Manual of Instruction; and to Miss Caroline A. Yale, Ph.D.,
Principal of Clarke School, Northampton, Mass., for the use of the
chart of consonant sounds.</p>

</div>

<p class="center large sb2">THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES
IN LEARNING TO READ.</p>


<p><b>Language Defined.</b> Language is the conventional means by which
man communicates his thoughts. It is a complex unity composed
of thought and symbol, spoken or written. Because it is the means
by which different minds are identified in thought, it becomes an
essential factor in social organization.</p>

<p><b>Symbolism.</b> In a wider sense all means of social communication,
material and pictorial expressions, as well as spoken and written
words, may be called language. Thought, through symbol, to thought,
is the whole social process of language, spoken and written, for
every meaning has a symbol and every symbol has a meaning.</p>

<p><b>The Problem in Learning to Read.</b> The problem in teaching reading
is to bring the symbol and its meaning into vital unity in the
mind of the learner. Hence it is necessary that the teacher distinguish
clearly between these elements. When the thought and
the symbol have become so united that each is essential to the other,
the problem of learning to read has been solved.</p>

<p><b>Fundamental Principles.</b> There are three chief fundamental
principles involved in the process of learning to read, namely:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i><b>First. Images.</b></i> The thought aspect of language depends
upon clear and vivid images. This is so important that unless
children have such images they cannot master the symbols
which represent them. One purpose of nature study, handicraft,
and art is to give children these images.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i><b>Second. Wholes to Parts.</b></i> In acquiring knowledge the mind
moves from the vague whole to the parts and then back again
to the clarified whole. An understanding of the parts gives
a fuller meaning to the whole. The mind analyzes in order to
reach a better synthesis. When we wish to make known to a
child a coat, for instance, we do not show him separately the
sleeves, the lapels, the pockets, the buttons. We hold up the
whole garment and say, "Here is a coat." It is necessary to
do the same in teaching reading. Give the child first an image
of the whole situation which he is to think himself into, and
then come to the details to make the whole clear.</p>

<p><i><b>Third. Self-Activity.</b></i> The child is an active, creative agent,
vitally concerned in adjusting himself to his physical and spiritual
environment. Self-activity manifests itself in some external
form, which in language is the symbol of the self-active
thought. Success in teaching reading depends upon the amount
of self-active response the symbol awakens in the thought of
the child.</p>
</div>

<p>These three fundamental principles, namely, clear and vivid
images, whole situations, and self-activity in the form of response
and interest on the part of the child, should be kept in the foreground
in teaching reading.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p  class="center xlarge">2.</p>
</div>

<p class="center large sb2">ELEMENTS IN LEARNING TO READ.</p>

<p>Since language is composed of thought, symbol, and sound, the
main elements to be considered in learning to read are the thought,
the symbol, and the phonic elements.</p>

<p  class="center sa2 sb2">THE THOUGHT ELEMENT.</p>

<p><b>The Purpose of the Thought Element.</b> The problem of elementary
reading is to establish a permanent association between the
written or the printed symbols and the thoughts which they
represent. The thought is all-important; it is the vitalizing element
in learning to read. In learning to talk the child associates
the meaning with the spoken symbol; in learning to read he associates
a thought content with a sight symbol. The strength of the
association depends in each case upon the worth the thought has for
the child; hence the great necessity of giving especial attention to
the thought element in learning to read.</p>

<p><b>Action Sentences.</b> A sentence is the unit of language and the life-giving
factor in the process of learning to read. It is important,
therefore, that in the beginning the child should form the habit of
grasping sentences. In the first reading lessons it is necessary to
find subjects which interest the child and furnish clear mental pictures.
Children are interested in actions. They like to move and
will read for the purpose of performing an action. Action sentences
appeal to all children, because that which a child does makes
a deep impression and involves large self-activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p><b>Nursery Rhymes.</b> Children are so influenced by rhythm that it
is impossible to train them aright without giving due consideration
to this form of expression. There are many interesting complete
rhymes and poems that are valuable for reading lessons. In content
the poetry of childhood should contain familiar images, tinged
with enough of mystery to give that subtle mingling of sense and
nonsense which stirs the imagination of the child and also relates
him to the actual world in which he lives. The Mother Goose melodies
fulfil these conditions, but it is the rhythm far more than the
thought that attracts the child. Have the children learn the rhymes
by ear and recite them with no thought other than that they are to
be enjoyed. Incidentally, they will afford valuable exercise in pronunciation,
articulation, and tone modulation, if the teacher is careful
about these matters, for children are great imitators. Later the
children will read these rhymes and poems with great pleasure, thus
associating a valuable thought content with its printed symbol in a
way that will make the association abiding.</p>

<p><b>Stories.</b> Children express in action, and ultimately in character,
the influences which they receive from stories. Therefore, stories
containing true and good ideals should be selected. Children appreciate
and love what appeals to the best and the highest in them.
Nursery rhymes, fables, fairy lore, and classic myth should be used.
They have nourished the race, and will also feed the soul life of the
individual child. The outer form varies with the age and the
country, but the inner meaning is of the spirit and will outlast the
centuries. Every teacher should, therefore, carefully cultivate the
art of story-telling. It is far better to present a story orally than to
read it from a book. If it is told, the teacher can adapt it to the
needs of her classes, and by the magnetism of voice, eye, and personality
awaken an abiding love for good literature. At a later
period the child will enjoy reading these same stories in the reading
books of the first and second grades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p><b>Observation Lessons.</b> Observation and description should precede
reading in the early lessons. The teacher may write on the blackboard
simple sentences based upon these observations and descriptions.
Anything in the environment of the home or the school which
interests the child should be utilized. Encourage the children to
observe their household pets and to tell the other children about
them. Whatever the child makes in the time devoted to handicraft,
or observes in the nature lessons, or plays in the recreation period
may be used as material for reading lessons. Color is so intimately
connected with the emotional life that its value and importance
should be recognized.</p>


<p class="center sa2 sb2">THE SYMBOL ELEMENT.</p>

<p><b>Use.</b> All thought which rises to the plane of self-consciousness is
communicated by means of a material, a pictorial, or a lingual symbol.
The thought element and the symbol element are two sides of the
same thing, namely, language. They form the <i>impression</i> and <i>expression</i>
of language, and hence of social communication and identity.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Symbols.</b> There are two kinds of symbols which must be
mastered in learning to read, namely, the vocal and the graphic, appealing
respectively to the ear and to the eye. These symbols are
made by the voice and the hand, and are recognized by the ear and
the eye. They must always be regarded in the light of that which
they represent in connection with elementary reading, whether used
in receiving or expressing thought. This thought must be kept
clearly in mind in silent and oral reading, in word repetition, and
in word drill. It will aid also in the spelling and the phonic work
of the children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p class="center sa2 sb2">THE PHONIC ELEMENT.</p>

<p><b>Definition.</b> The phonic element deals with articulate sounds
and the letters or the symbols which represent them. Here, as
elsewhere in learning to read, the unity between meaning and
symbol—impression and expression—must be kept clearly in mind.
The spoken symbol implies training in pronunciation, enunciation,
articulation, inflection, and all that makes for clear understanding
and agreeable oral expression of thought. Ear and voice, eye and
hand, are tools which must be trained to work with automatic perfection
as the means in communicating thought.</p>

<p><b>Purpose.</b> The purpose of the phonic lesson is the association of a
sound with its written or printed symbol, so that the child will be
able to get and to express the sound when the symbol is presented
to him. The sight symbol and the sound symbol should be so
thoroughly associated that immediately upon the presentation of
either one of them the other will appear in consciousness.</p>

<p><b>Ear and Voice Training.</b> It is of the utmost importance that children
be given a broad experience with sound in the way of ear and
voice training exercises for a few weeks before the formal study of
phonics is begun. These exercises may be carried on in connection
with the thought development in learning to read and in the music
work. In the nature work the children should be trained to listen
to bird note, insect hum, and other sounds of nature. Story-telling
is most helpful in this ear training. It should begin in the first
grade and continue through the entire elementary school period.
The reading of poems aloud should be a regular part of the school
program, not only to stimulate the imagination, but also to give the
enjoyment that comes from the cadence of rhythmic language and
to train the ear to make fine discriminations. Ear training and
voice culture are so intimately related that it is impossible to cultivate
one without cultivating the other, for they sustain to each
other the vital relation of impression and expression.</p>

<p><b>Phonic Facts.</b> The question of the exact number of elementary
sounds in the English language is still unsettled. This Manual is
based on the belief that there are forty-five elementary sounds
in the English language, twenty vowel sounds and twenty-five
consonant sounds. The difficulty in mastering the phonic element
in learning to read English is greatly increased because some of the
elementary sounds are represented by two letters, as <i>th</i> in <i>thin</i>, <i>ea</i>
in <i>head</i>; and some sounds are represented by two or more symbols,
as <i>e</i> in <i>her</i>, <i>u</i> in <i>turn</i>, and <i>i</i> in <i>firm</i>. It is neither necessary nor desirable
that little children should learn all the equivalent symbols;
nor is it considered wise to give to children all of the forty-five
elementary sounds. Forty is the number taught in the phonic
lessons of this Manual. Use has determined the order of presentation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. <i><b>Vowel Sounds.</b></i> The vowels are always pure sound.
They express the emotions and are the rhythmic, musical
element which gives language its beauty. There are many
equivalent spellings for the twenty elementary vowel sounds
in the English language. Those most frequently used are
found on page 113; the others will be learned unconsciously as
the child develops. See page 113 for a scientific arrangement
of the vowel sounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>2. <i><b>Consonant Sounds.</b></i> The consonants limit and define
sound. Of the twenty-five elementary consonant sounds, ten
have no vocal quality whatever. They are commonly known as
breath sounds—<i><b>f, h, k, p, s, t, ch, sh, th, wh</b></i>. With the
exception of <i><b>h</b></i>, every one of these breath sounds has its corresponding
vocal sound:</p>

<p>See p. 112 for a scientific arrangement of the consonant sounds.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>3. <i><b>Phonograms</b></i>. In all the phonic lessons used in this
Manual a <i><b>phonogram is the symbol of a sound group</b></i>, usually
composed of a single vowel sound combined with a single
consonant sound. For example, <i><b>ing</b></i> in <i><b>s-ing</b></i> is a phonogram,
but in <i><b>see-ing</b></i> it is a syllable.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Diacritical Marks.</b> Useless phonograms are a burden rather
than a help; therefore the child should learn only those which
he actually uses. For this reason it is not advisable to use diacritical
marks during the earlier stages of learning to read. They
make the symbol complex and cumbersome, and at the same time
their need and great value do not become apparent until the child
begins to use the dictionary, say, in the fourth school year. In the
earlier stages of learning to read, symbols acquire meaning by being
constantly associated with their respective sounds and thoughts.
Habits of pronunciation are formed by always attaching the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
sound values to letters and groups of letters. When a child forms
an image of a word burdened with diacritical marks, he must later
form an image of the word without these. When children are
taught to look for diacritical marks their imaging power is centered
upon the markings of the words instead of the thoughts for which
these words stand; hence it takes longer to get the thought, and as
a consequence they are apt to be slow readers. Rapid readers are
usually thoughtful readers, because they have the power to grasp
quickly a large number of words and to interpret them in mental
pictures.</p>

<p><b>Phonic Drill.</b> Phonic drill and reading are distinct processes and
should be taught at different periods of the day during the first two
years of school. The purpose of the elementary reading lesson is
to associate permanently the thought and the symbols which represent
it, so that the thought can be gained from the written or
printed language. The purpose of the elementary phonic lesson is
to associate permanently sounds and the characters which represent
them, so that new words can be readily recognized. Both processes
are necessary in teaching reading, but phonic lessons should be relegated
to a subsidiary place so that they may not become an impediment
to the main purpose.</p>

<p><b>Phonic Method.</b> In the phonic method sight words are analyzed
into their elements, which are then combined in new relations to
form new words. These new combinations of familiar elements in
new relations are recognized again and again, until the association
grows permanent, and so new words are acquired. Consonant
sounds are recognized as initial, final, and medial. Next the phonogram
element is analyzed into its vowel and consonant sounds. By
means of familiar symbols the child has the power to pronounce new
words. A knowledge of individual symbols is the foundation upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
which the sight recognition of words rests; hence the necessity of
rapid and varied drills.</p>

<p>The method suggested in this Manual for phonic lessons is as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Separate sight words into their consonant sounds and
phonograms.</p>

<p>2. Separate phonograms into their consonant and vowel
sounds.</p>

<p>3. Associate these sound elements with their symbols.</p>

<p>4. Combine the sound elements to form new words (Phonic
Synthesis).</p>

<p>5. Teach initial and final syllables as phonograms.</p>

<p class="center large sb2">METHODS OF TEACHING READING.</p>

<p>Methods of learning to read are the result of bringing the different
thought, symbol, and phonic elements into combination and
active co-operation. The process is organic and all these features
must be kept in mind. There are two kinds of reading, silent and
oral.</p>

<p><b>Silent Reading.</b> Silent reading is the personal, individual way of
getting thought from the printed page. The teacher must lead the
pupil to see that the sentences have meaning. From the very
first the teacher should never lose sight of this fundamental principle
and should train the child into the habit of interpreting the printed
page into mental pictures. A good method of conducting the
reading lesson is the following:</p>

<p>Let each child read the entire lesson silently to get the thought
(whole to parts). When the child does not recognize a word and
cannot get it from the context or the sound elements, tell him what
it is, in as simple a way as he would be told about a new object in
the home. When he has finished reading the child may show that
he is ready to give the thought. The teacher requests a pupil to
give in his own language what he has just read. It will then be
seen how vivid his images are of what he has read and how fully it
has appealed to him. At the same time, his expressing it in his own
words will exercise his self-activity. It is not wise in the beginning
to correct imperfect language to any great extent, for the reason
that the child's attention is liable to be diverted from the main
thought to some detail of the medium of expression. This is disastrous
and will tend to make him unnatural in both his thinking and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
feeling. It destroys his appreciation for the whole, blurs his images,
and takes away the chief motive for reading.</p>

<p>In learning to read the child begins with the image of some story,
which he particularizes and clarifies by the thoughts in the sentences
and the ideas in the words. He masters the word elements in this
way, as a unity of meaning and symbol, which gives significance to
the sentence and to the story as a whole. Thus the power of getting
thought from the printed page develops.</p>

<p><b>Oral Reading.</b> Oral reading is the process of interpreting thought
from the printed page and imparting it to another by means of the
voice. Silent reading should always precede oral reading, so that
the child may get the thought before he attempts to give it. Silent
reading is the power to translate the words into thoughts or
emotions. Oral reading goes a step further and gives these thoughts
and emotions audible expression and awakens them in another.
Silent reading is a necessity; oral reading is an accomplishment.
Oral reading is another way of telling a story. It implies the
ability to awaken one's thoughts in another's mind. It lacks the
freedom of expression usual in story-telling, for it demands power
to interpret and transmit thought almost simultaneously.</p>

<p>There are many ways of conducting an oral reading lesson. Two
methods are given for illustration:</p>

<p>These methods differ only in the breadth and scope of the
image of the whole that the child is to think through at one time.</p>

<p>Freedom of expression usually accompanies the reading of interesting
thought. The child will usually use natural, clear tones in
reading, as he does in talking, if he understands what he
reads. Many children read poorly because they neither understand
nor feel any meaning in the words. Both gesture and language
will be spontaneous if prompted by right thinking and right feeling.
The dramatic presentation of a story, however crude, becomes a
great aid.</p>

<p><b>Word Repetition.</b> Many repetitions of words, phrases, and sentences
are necessary in mastering the symbol. It is quite possible
to have a repetition of words with an ever-changing variety in valuable
thought. This variety holds the interest of the children and at
the same time accustoms the eye to the repeated symbol. The
symbol elements in the action sentences, observation lessons, nursery
rhymes, and stories must be repeated many times, but, to preserve
interest in them and to increase their meaning, the greatest
care must be taken in the selection and the presentation of the
thought element. If the teacher of elementary reading can master
this part of her work, her success is well-nigh assured.</p>


<p class="center sa2 sb2">SPELLING.</p>

<p><b>Notion and Purpose.</b> Spelling is a finer analysis of the process
of learning to read and hence involves all the elements of learning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
to read. The problem in learning to spell is to associate permanently
the smallest symbols of the word, the letters, oral and written,
with their appropriate meanings. In oral spelling the impression is
received through the ear; the expression is by means of the voice.
In written spelling the impression is received through the eye; the expression
is by means of the hand. Because written spelling occupies
a much larger place in life through the need of communicating ideas
by means of writing, it should receive more attention in language
teaching than oral spelling. The training of the eye and the hand
is, therefore, more important in learning to spell than the training of
the ear and the voice, although oral spelling sometimes helps by
bringing in the auditory and the vocal memory to assist the visual
and the manual. In the beginning children should learn to spell by
<i>writing</i>, not as a drill in penmanship, but for the purpose of calling
attention to the form of the word.</p>

<p><b>Elements.</b> Spelling is a complex and difficult art and requires
(a) training in elementary sounds and their symbols, or phonic drill;
(b) training of eye and hand in forming the letters of a word, or
written spelling; (c) training of ear and voice in naming the letters
of a word, or oral spelling. Sound, form, and name of letters must
be inseparably associated, so that they will become necessary elements
in the vital combination of symbol and meaning in the word.</p>

<p><b>Method.</b> In the method pursued the teacher writes <i>Sing.</i>, for
instance, upon the blackboard, with capital letter and period to indicate
that it is the expression of a complete thought. The teacher
then erases the word and requests the children to write it. Review
this word at the next lesson and add a new one. Next the teacher
writes <i>I can sing. Can you sing?</i>, and similar sentences, upon the
blackboard, and proceeds in the same manner. As the work progresses
the children should image a new sentence at each lesson, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
in addition should be able to write from dictation several review
sentences. In the early lessons the children should write at the
blackboard, or use unruled paper and soft lead pencils with dull
points. A clear image of the symbol will aid the child in writing it.
This makes it essential that the teacher write a legible hand.</p>

<p><b>Word Drill.</b> Drill upon the words learned is necessary to
mechanize ear, voice, eye, and hand in the reading process so that
the child may be left free to attend to the subject-matter. Have
the children pronounce, write, and spell the unfamiliar words
found in the reading lesson. Insist upon exact pronunciation and a
natural, pleasing modulation of the voice. Later the children should
use these same words in spoken and written sentences. After children
have learned the names of the letters, both oral and written
spelling should be used, since they are correlative processes. Oral
spelling often deepens the impression and makes the image more
permanent.</p>


<p class="center sa2 sb2">THE ALPHABET.</p>

<p>The alphabet should be taught in serial order, because of its use
in reading card catalogs, dictionaries, etc. The alphabet characters
have been learned in the phonic drill by associating the sounds with
the letters as the children require them to master words, but not
consecutively. The A B C's, however, in their old-fashioned
significance, should be a part of the child's knowledge when he
enters the second grade.</p>


<p class="center sa2 sb2">SUMMARY.</p>

<p>In the process of learning to read, certain elements are brought
together and associated in vital organic unity in accordance with
broad general principles. These the teacher must keep constantly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
in mind if she is to succeed. Reading, like all language, is a combination
of thought and symbol. The thought gives the meaning
and is the <i>reason</i> for reading, while the symbol is only the tool and
instrument of the thought. Care must be taken to see (a) that the
child forms clear images of what he is reading; and (b) that he obeys
the fundamental law of mind of proceeding from wholes to parts.
By holding these principles in full view and giving the thought
element the leading place, the symbol and phonic elements will fall
into their proper place in accomplishing the purpose of elementary
reading, namely, the association of the symbol and its meaning in
a vital unity.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EAR_TRAINING_EXERCISES">EAR TRAINING EXERCISES.</h2>
</div>


<p><b>Directions.</b> 1. The purpose of ear training is to familiarize the
child with the elementary sounds in the language, so that he may
have accurate sound images before associating them with the corresponding
symbols.</p>

<p>2. Give the sounds of the letters, not the names. Teach the
letter-names later in the Phonic Lessons. Give the sounds softly but
distinctly. A loud, harsh voice makes purity of sound impossible.</p>

<p>3. Cultivate the attentive ear in children. Teach them to hear,
and then to image, the song of the birds, the patter of the rain, the
sound of the wind, the hum of the bee, the puff of the locomotive
and other familiar sounds.</p>

<p>4. The rhymes and poems are suggestive, not final. The
teacher may choose others if they better meet her need. Those selected
from song literature have a tone quality that will interest
children and prove helpful in training the ear. Read the poems
aloud in a well modulated voice, with clear articulation, that the
children may become sensitive to the beauty of the human voice.</p>

<p>5. Ear training should precede the formal study of phonics for
a few weeks. The exact time required cannot be arbitrarily named,
because it depends not only upon the ability of the class but also
upon the teaching power of the one in charge. From six to eight
weeks, with daily periods ten or fifteen minutes in length, will accomplish
good results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>


<p class="center sa2">I.</p>

<p>Consonant sounds are taught by phonic analysis of words, and
not by any artificial device. Ear training exercises are helpful as
a preparation for this work. Let the first sounding be done <i>by the
teacher</i> and have the children perform the actions as she slightly
separates the sound elements. In this way the ear soon becomes
accustomed to the formation of words from their phonic elements.</p>

<p><i><b>Caution.</b></i> There should be no abruptness about such an exercise.
The slight separation and the gentle prolonging are sufficient to
keep the children listening and interested. Avoid giving to separate
consonants, sounds which they do not possess.</p>


<p class="center sa2">II.</p>

<p><b>Slow Pronunciation of Names.</b> Children are interested in their
own names; if they pronounce these slowly they will begin to distinguish
sounds. The teacher first pronounces her own name as the
children watch, making prominent the initial sound. She then calls
upon different children to pronounce their names. <i>Ex.</i>: A child
named Mary says: "My name is M-ary," emphasizing the sound
"M." Another says, "My name is R-obert," emphasizing the sound
"R," etc.</p>

<p><b>Singing Games.</b> The old-fashioned singing games, such as "Here
We Go Round the Mulberry Bush," "London Bridge," "Looby
Loo," etc., will delight the children and are excellent exercises for
ear training. (See <i>Folk Songs and Games</i> by Marie Ruef Hofer.)</p>


<p class="center sa2">IV.</p>

<p><b>Phonic Game.</b> <i>What is it?</i> A child acts as leader and stands in
the front of the room. The children in their seats question him until
the supply of rhymes is exhausted. <i>Ex.</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Leader: I'm thinking of something that rhymes with <i>top</i>.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Child: Is it chop?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Leader: It is not chop.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Child: Is it hop?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Leader: It is hop.</span><br>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Object</i>. Grouping of words with like phonograms and final consonants.</p>


<p class="center sa2">V.</p>

<p><b>Phonic Game.</b> <i>Guess.</i> Ask a child to leave the room. Children
in their seats choose a word. When the child returns he either acts
out the word he has in mind or describes it. <i>Ex.</i>:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Action.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>
We are thinking of something that rhymes with <i>bat</i>.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is it this? (Child guessing puts on a hat.)</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No. It is not hat.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is it this? (Child guessing pats his head.)</span><br>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">No. It is not pat.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is it this? (Child guessing says <i>Meow</i>.)</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yes. It is cat.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Is it a pretty color?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">It is not red.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Is it something we sleep in?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">It is not bed.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Is it a boy's name?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Yes. It is Ned.</span><br>
</p></blockquote>


<p class="center sa2">VI.</p>

<p><b>Phonic Game.</b> <i>Hide and Seek.</i> Teacher gives the first rhyme.
She then calls upon a child to give a rhyme using the same initial
letter. This child then calls upon another child. Continue in this
way until the rhymes are exhausted. <i>Ex.</i>:</p>

<p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PRELIMINARY_BLACKBOARD_LESSONS">PRELIMINARY BLACKBOARD LESSONS.<br>
<span class="small center">(Time, about eight weeks.)</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Directions.</b>1. This Manual contains thirty Preliminary Blackboard
Lessons. The purpose is to associate thought and symbol.
These preliminary lessons anticipate the first twenty-nine pages in
the Primer but do not exactly reproduce the text. By means of
the blackboard work the pupil accumulates a small initial vocabulary
which enables him to read the lessons in the Primer with no fear or
uncertainty of the text.</p>

<p>2. There is no exact limit to the number of Preliminary Blackboard
Lessons that should be taught. Those given in the Manual
indicate the order of development, not the time. American children
will master the lessons given in from six to eight weeks.
Foreign children will require a little more time, since they must
learn to associate thought with both the spoken and the written
symbol. When children read lessons written on the blackboard
with ease, put the Primer in their hands.</p>

<p class="center">I.</p>

<p>The teacher writes the action sentence <i>Run.</i> on the blackboard in
a clear, distinct hand. The initial capital and the period at the end
are consistently used, so that from the beginning the children are
accustomed to them. After writing the word the teacher expresses
the action by running. If her dignity will not permit her
to do this, she may bring in a child from the second or third grade
and ask him to perform whatever action is indicated by the word
written upon the board. The word is not spoken at this time;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
the child discovers the meaning from the action. The whole
purpose of the teacher is to associate the thought expressed
by the action with its written symbol. Let this word remain
on the board; write it in a larger hand near the place where
the word was first written. Again let the teacher or child perform
the act. Select another board; write the word in a smaller hand.
Again express the thought in action. The class will watch this
with deep interest. Some member of the class will soon associate
the written word with the action, and will stand upon the first round
of the ladder leading to the interpretation of thought from written
symbols.</p>

<p>The reason for writing the word in a larger and a smaller hand,
and especially in different places on the blackboard, is to prevent
local association. Then, too, the change of place will intensify the
child's interest and attention.</p>

<p>Make the reading lesson short and repeat it at intervals during
the day. If fifteen minutes is the time set apart for reading, divide
this into three five-minute periods. The lesson period should be
lengthened as the work advances.</p>

<p>Teach one word a day and review those previously taught.
Write the words on the blackboard a number of times arranged
irregularly, and have frequent short drills upon them.</p>

<p>These four verbs, <i>Run</i>, <i>Hop</i>, <i>Jump</i>, and <i>Sing</i>, have been found
by practical experience to be very good ones for the beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
lessons. They will occur again and again in the later stories about
animals and pets. They are also used in the stories about the
plays and games which children delight to reproduce in the reading
lesson.</p>


<p class="center">V.</p>

<p class="center"><b>REVIEW.</b></p>

<p>Three methods of presenting a reading lesson are suggested:</p>


<p class="center"><i><b>A</b></i></p>

<p>1. The teacher writes an action word on the blackboard.</p>

<p>2. The teacher asks a child to perform the action.</p>

<p>3. The child looks at the blackboard and reads the word.<br>
(This is the beginning of oral reading.)</p>


<p class="center"><i><b>B</b></i></p>

<p>1. The teacher asks a child to perform any action he
chooses.</p>

<p>2. The teacher asks another child to tell what the first one
did.</p>

<p>3. The teacher writes the action word on the blackboard.</p>


<p class="center"><i><b>C</b></i></p>

<p>1. One child tells another what action to perform.</p>

<p>2. The child performs the action.</p>

<p>3. The teacher writes the word on the blackboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>Many devices will suggest themselves to the progressive teacher
if she clearly understands that the purpose of the lesson is to associate
the thought with its written or printed symbol. If the child,
after observing a word written on the blackboard, expresses the
thought in action, he shows that he has read it.</p>


<p class="center">VI.</p>

<p class="center"><i><b>and.</b></i></p>

<p>The teacher writes sentences like the following on the blackboard:</p>

<table><tbody>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Run and jump.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Jump and run.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Run and hop.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Hop and run.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Run and jump and hop.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Jump and hop and run.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>Endless combinations may be made with these words, giving constant
change of thought while repeating the words. It is quite
possible in this way to have word repetition with variety of thought.</p>

<p>Each time a sentence is written on the blackboard the process is
as follows:</p>

<table><tbody>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">First:  Observe the words. (Silent reading.)</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Second: Express the thought in action.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Third:  Pronounce the words. (Oral reading.)</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>Some children grasp the sentence form as unconsciously as they
do the word form. If they fail to do so, teach the use of the
capital letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Vary the lesson by introducing the names of children in the
class, thus:</p>

<table><tbody>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Run and jump, Mary.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">John, hop and jump.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<p class="center">VII.</p>

<p class="center"><i><b>I can.</b></i></p>

<p>The phrase <i>I can</i> is next introduced. Write upon the blackboard
the sentence <i>I can run</i>. Read it to the children. Have a child perform
the action and then read the sentence aloud. Proceed in this
way with other action sentences. Group the sentences in various
ways and have frequent reviews.</p>

<table><tbody>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">I can sing.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">I can hop.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">I can run and jump.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">I can jump and hop.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">I can hop, and run, and jump.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>


</tbody></table>

<p>The reading process consists of three steps:</p>

<table><tbody>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">First: Silent reading.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Second: The thought expressed in action.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Third: Oral reading.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>After teaching the sentence as a whole, it should be analyzed into
words. For instance, ask a child to pass to the blackboard and
point to <i>I can</i> as many times as he finds it written. Point to <i>run</i>,
etc. This may be varied by asking a child to underscore or erase
the words that are alike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>


<p class="center">VIII.</p>

<p class="center"><i><b>Rover</b></i>.</p>

<p>Household pets, anything and everything that is familiar to a child
and in which he is interested, will serve as material for reading lessons.
Rover is a universal name for a dog and hence is arbitrarily
used for illustrative purposes in these lessons. If Dash happens to
be a better name known to the child, use that. Sentences like the
following will suggest themselves:</p>

<table><tbody>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Rover can run.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Rover can jump.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Rover can run and jump.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">I can hop.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Rover and I can run.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<p class="center">IX.</p>

<p class="center"><i><b>Kitty</b></i>.</p>

<p>Kittens are a never failing source of interest to children. At a
suggestion from the teacher the children themselves will give sentences
like the following:</p>

<table><tbody>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Kitty can jump.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Kitty can run.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Kitty and I can run.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Kitty and I can jump.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Kitty and Rover can run and jump.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>The teacher writes these sentences upon the blackboard as they
are given to her by the different children. She then calls upon other
children to read them. A child may pretend that she is Kitty and
dramatize the action. This dramatic instinct is universal in children
and should be recognized throughout the school life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p class="center">X.</p>

<p class="center"><i><b>You.</b></i></p>

<p>The question form is easily learned and should be introduced in
the early lessons. Combine familiar words in new relations:</p>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Can you run?</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>

</tbody></table>

<p class="sa2"></p>
<table><tbody>
<tr><td class="tdl">XI. XII.</td>
<td class="tdc">XIII. XIV. XV.</td>
<td class="tdr">XVI. XVII.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Write upon the blackboard in a vertical row several <i>I see</i> sentences.
Have the children read them. Erase <i>I see</i> in each sentence,
leaving <i>Rover</i>, <i>Kitty</i>, <i>you</i>. Again, place several <i>I see</i> sentences upon
the blackboard. Erase <i>Rover</i>, <i>Kitty</i>, <i>you</i>, leaving <i>I see</i>, <i>I see</i>, <i>I see</i>.
Erase <i>I</i>, leaving the single word <i>see</i>.</p>

<p>Continue in this way with the phrases <i>I can see</i>, <i>I have</i>, <i>I like</i>, <i>I love</i>.</p>

<p>Children are interested in home life, therefore introduce the words
<i>father</i>, <i>mother</i>, <i>brother</i>, <i>sister</i>, <i>baby</i> in the early lessons.</p>

<p>Teach the articles <i>a</i>, <i>an</i>, <i>the</i> in connection with their nouns in
order to secure natural expression.</p>

<p>Review these words in new sentences which combine familiar
words in new relations. <i>Ex.</i>:</p>

<p>From this time on it will add to the interest if the sentences are
so connected that they tell a story. The following method has
been found helpful:</p>

<p>Suppose a bird has been observed. The children have something
to say and this serves as material for a reading lesson. First
one child and then another expresses his thought about the bird.
The teacher writes the easiest of these sentences upon the blackboard,
the result being somewhat as follows:</p>

<table><tbody>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">I see a bird.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">It is a blue bird.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">The blue bird can sing.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">The blue bird can hop.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>The teacher asks the children to read silently the entire story.
As soon as each child is ready he may rise and turn his back to
the blackboard. He then gives the thought in his own language.</p>

<p><i>Ex.</i>:</p>
<table><tbody>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">I see a blue bird.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">The blue bird can sing and hop.</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

</tbody></table>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p class="sa2">Call upon different children to express the thought, and accept
any condensation of language which shows this power. The purpose
in asking the child to interpret the whole story in his own
language is to show that he has the <i>thought</i>.</p>

<p>The children are now ready to analyze the story into sentences.
A good device is to cover the story with a curtain provided for the
purpose. Raise the curtain and ask the children to observe, let
us say, the third sentence. Cover this and ask a child to give the
exact language. </p>

<p><i>Ex.</i>:</p>
<p class="center sb2">The blue bird can sing.</p>

<p>If he cannot do so, raise the curtain again and let him observe.
Continue in this way with the other sentences, showing them to the
children in an irregular order. The purpose of this is to show that
the children not only have the thought as a whole, but that they
know the words in each sentence.</p>

<p>By this method children are trained to read groups of words at a
glance. They observe the sentence as a whole, image it as a whole,
and read it as a whole. Comprehension of the thought leads to
freedom of expression. In consequence, pupils will not be heard
pronouncing disconnected words in unnatural, artificial tones.</p>


<p>The development of the lesson is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>First: Children observe and express.</p>

<p>Second: The teacher writes this expression on the blackboard.
When a story of three or four sentences is complete
the order of interpretation is as follows:</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="sa2">First: Children observe and image. (Silent reading.)</p>

<p>Second: Each child in turn expresses the whole thought.</p>

<p>Third: The children read each sentence. (Oral reading.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>Color appeals to all children. Frequent use of it should be made
in describing birds, flowers, and animals in the first reading lessons.
The following are suggestive lessons containing such words as <i>big</i>,
<i>little</i>, <i>pretty</i>, and adjectives of color.</p>

<p>Experience proves that a rapid and easy way for children to learn
to read is by means of nursery rhymes and simple poems. The
method of presenting a rhyme is as follows:</p>

<p>Have the children learn the rhyme by ear and repeat it aloud.
Write the rhyme <i>Two Little Blackbirds</i>, on the board. (See Primer,
page 23. In order that recognition may take place when the same
rhymes are seen in print, carefully copy the arrangement of the text
as found in the Primer.) Draw a pointer slowly under each line as
the children repeat the rhyme. Do this several times until they begin
to associate the spoken symbol with the written symbol. Children
will soon recognize the elements most prominent.</p>

<p>After teaching the rhyme as a whole, analyze it into parts.
Write lines, phrases, and words in different places on the blackboard.
Have the children observe, image, and find these in the rhyme. <i>Ex.</i>:
<i>Two little blackbirds</i>; <i>upon a hill</i>; <i>one was named</i>; <i>fly away</i>; <i>come
again</i>.</p>

<p>Ask a child to find all the words that are alike. <i>Ex.</i>: <i>Jack</i>; <i>Jill</i>;
<i>named</i>; <i>fly</i>; <i>come</i>; <i>again</i>; etc. Ask another child to find and name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
all the words he knows. Let volunteers find lines, phrases, and
words called for by other children who see them. In some such
way as this every symbol can be brought to the child's consciousness.</p>

<p>When the children are familiar with the words comprising the
rhyme they are ready to read sentences and stories using these same
words in new relations. Keep the rhyme on the blackboard for
reference. When in doubt about a word let the child find it himself
by repeating the rhyme until he reads that word.</p>

<p class="sa2">A summary of the steps involved:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Memorize the rhyme in order to acquire the thought.</p>

<p>2. Associate this thought with the written symbols.</p>

<p>3. Separate the rhyme into sentences, phrases, and words.</p>

<p>4. Combine these parts in new wholes; that is, in new sentences
and stories.</p>
</div>

<p>One essential principle in learning to read is that the thought shall
be familiar and interesting. The purpose of the elementary reading
lesson is to associate old thought with a new symbol.</p>

<p>This same rhyme may be modified and used as a game. Select
two children with blue ribbons, dresses, suits, or neckties, to impersonate
bluebirds. Substitute their names and write the rhyme on
the board as follows:</p>

<table><tbody>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdc">Two little bluebirds</td>
<td class="tdr"></td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>Have the two bluebirds read the words from the blackboard, run
to a corner of the room, and stoop down to dramatize the words
"sat upon a hill." At the words "fly away" the little birds run
around the room with outstretched arms to imitate the flying motion.
At the words "come again" they should return to their original
position. This exercise gives repetition of words with variety of
thought.</p>

<p>Memorize the rhyme. Children like to express thought in
action, therefore when memorizing the rhyme let them hold
imaginary babies in their arms and gently rock them to the rhythm
of the words.</p>

<p>Write the rhyme on the blackboard. Write the lines, phrases,
and words elsewhere on the blackboard. Let the children observe
these and find them in the rhyme. <i>Rock-a-by</i>; <i>In the tree-top</i>;

<p><b>See-Saw.</b> (Primer, page 24.) Children like to recite to appropriate
action. Rhythmic movement may be taught with the "See-Saw"
rhyme as follows: While repeating the first two lines sink

the second line bend alternately to the right and left three times.
Repeat these motions with the third and fourth lines.</p>

<p><b>The Transition from Script to Print.</b> It is impossible to give a
fixed rule stating the time when the child should pass from the
blackboard script to the book. This varies with the age and
ability of the pupils. The observant teacher knows when to place
printed material in the hands of the child by the readiness and ease
with which he reads from the blackboard. It will be necessary to
write the first lessons in the Primer on the blackboard for the children
to observe the resemblance between that which is written upon
the board and that which is printed in the book. Every primary
teacher should <i>write a clear, legible hand</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>:—"<i>The Old Woman and Her Pig</i>," "<i>The House that

</div>

<p><b>Directions.</b> 1. There are seventeen rhymes and simple poems
in the Primer. The vocabulary is based on the words found in these
rhymes and poems. Have the children memorize each rhyme.
Write it upon the blackboard and teach the elements as in previous
exercises. (See page 43, Part II, Lesson XXVII.)</p>

<p>2. Continue the blackboard lessons along with the reading of the
Primer. If necessary, precede a lesson in the book with one or more
development lessons on the blackboard. (See page 39, Part II,
Lesson XXI.)</p>

<p>3. The enjoyment of poetry must be recognized as a legitimate
part of the child's development. To meet this need a Supplementary
List of Poems is given to be read in connection with the Primer
lessons. Wherever possible the poems have been chosen from books
of selected poems, because these are usually more accessible.</p>


<p><b>Reading from the Primer.</b> Page 31, Paragraph 1. Ask a child
to read the words spoken by Robin Redbreast; ask another child to
read the words spoken by Pussy Cat; ask a third child to read the
descriptive portions of the lesson.</p>

<p>Paragraph 2. Have the children read the sentences silently and
observe the picture on the opposite page. Answer the directions
aloud.</p>

<p>Proceed in the same way with paragraph 2, on page 32.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>


<p>Page 43. While reciting the second part of each stanza have the
children imitate the action named. This may also be played as a
"Singing Game." (See <i>Songs, Games and Rhymes</i> by Eudora
Lucas Hailmann.)</p>


<p>Page 45. Paragraph 1—Read the questions silently and answer
them aloud. Proceed in the same way with similar lessons throughout
the Primer.</p>

<p>Paragraph 2. Observation Game: Place a nut or some other
object in a box. Let the children observe this for an instant only.
Use for a blackboard lesson as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
1. Teacher, write question upon the blackboard.<br>
2. Children, read the question silently.<br>
3. Children, answer the question aloud.<br>
</div>

<p>The following is a suggestive method for the reading lesson on
Page 45, paragraph 2. Ask two children to read the lesson as a
dialogue. <i>Ex.</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
First Child: "Is it a red ball?"<br>
Second Child: "No. It is not a red ball." Etc.<br>
</div>


<p>Page 48. Rhythmic movement may accompany this lesson.
Have four children cross right hands to form a windmill. Turn in
time while repeating the rhyme <i>Blow, Wind! Blow!</i> Another
windmill motion may be taught as follows:</p>

<p>Two children stand back to back. Extend the arms and move
them alternately up and down with a gentle fanning motion. Have
the children in their seats recite the rhyme <i>Blow, Wind! Blow!</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>Page 62. Tap rhythmically with the finger tips upon the desk

<p>Page 72. Ask several children to pass around the room. Ask
a little boy to lift his cap as he passes by his friends and to greet them
by saying, "How do you do, Mary?" Ask a little girl to <i>bow</i>
to a friend as she passes by and to say, "How do you do,——?"
(See game "Going Walking" in <i>Popular Folk Games and Dances</i> by
Marie Ruef Hofer.) Use the words, "Good morning," if this form
of greeting is preferred. Explain to the children that the name
is added as a mark of courtesy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PHONIC_LESSONS">PHONIC LESSONS.<br>
<span class="small center">(Time, about twelve weeks.)</span></h2>
</div>

<p><b>Directions.</b> 1. There are twenty-five elementary consonant
sounds. The purpose of the phonic lessons is to associate these
consonant sounds with the letters representing them, and to become
accustomed to the use of phonograms based upon words in the
Primer. Word recognition should become automatic. See page 112
for a scientific arrangement of the consonant sounds.</p>

<p>2. All of the blackboard work should be written, not printed.
The child reproduces by a more or less unconscious imitation the
written forms which he sees upon the blackboard.</p>

<p>3. The lessons indicate the order; the time will vary with the
ability of the children and must be determined by the teacher.</p>


<p class="center">I.</p>

<p class="center"><i><b>r un</b></i>.</p>

<p>Begin with the word <i>run</i>. This is a part of the child's vocabulary,
having been learned in the early reading lessons. Appeal is made
first to the ear, then to the eye. The teacher conducts the lesson
as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>


<p><b>The Ear.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Pronounce <i>run</i> easily and naturally.</p>

<p>2. Give the sounds separately, thus: <i>r-un</i>.</p>

<p>3. Again pronounce the word. Call upon the children collectively
and individually to do the same.</p>
</div>


<p><b>The Eye.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Write the word <i>run</i> on the blackboard.</p>

<p>2. Cover the <i>un</i> and have the <i>r</i> sounded.</p>

<p>3. Cover the <i>r</i> and have the <i>un</i> sounded.</p>

<p>4. Uncover the whole word and ask the children to put the
two sounds together to make the word, <i>run</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>If the children cannot do this the teacher may do it for them,
making the sound <i>r</i> prominent. The ability to blend one sound with
another should not be a difficult phase of the work. The teacher's
attitude toward blending is the influence which makes it hard or easy
for the child.</p>

<p>To associate the sound <i>r</i> with its written symbol the following
method is suggested:</p>

<p>The teacher writes <i>r</i> upon the blackboard, giving the sound, not
the name. She then calls upon the children collectively and individually
to give the sound.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Teacher</i>: Close your eyes, children. Can you see how <i>r</i> looks?
(Give the sound, not the name.) Watch me make it again.</p>

<p>Teacher writes <i>r</i> slowly several times, then erases the work. Children
observe, image, and then write <i>r</i> upon the blackboard or upon
paper. If a mistake is made have the child erase, again observe the
teacher as she makes the letter, then write it a second time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>


<p class="center">II.</p>

<p class="center"><i><b>f.</b></i></p>

<p>Teach the word <i>fun</i> in the same manner that <i>run</i> was taught in
Lesson I. Write on the blackboard:</p>

<p class="center">
<i><b>r un</b></i><br>
<i><b>f un</b></i><br>
</p>

<p>Cover first one part and then the other, sounding each element.</p>

<p>Write <i>f</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>un</i>, on the blackboard a number of times, arranged irregularly.
Review daily, adding new consonants and phonograms
as they are taught.</p>


<p class="center">III.</p>

<p class="center"><i><b>s ing.</b></i></p>

<p>1. Separate both the spoken and the written word <i>sing</i> into the
phonic elements:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(a) <i>s</i> consonant sound.</p>

<p>(b) <i>ing</i> phonogram or sound group.</p>
</div>

<p>2. Associate each sound element with its written symbol.</p>

<p>3. Combine the consonants <i>r</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>s</i>, and the phonograms <i>un</i>, <i>ing</i>,
to form new words:</p>

<p><b>Phonic Drill.</b> Phonic Drill upon words from the Primer will each
day follow two lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I. A list of words to be separated into sounds (Phonic Analysis).</p>

<p>II. A list of familiar sounds to be combined in new relations to
form words (Phonic Synthesis).</p>
</div>

<p>Phonic Drill upon phonograms and the consonant sounds may be
given in two ways:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Combine different consonant sounds with the same phonogram.</p>

<p>2. Combine different phonograms with the same consonant
sound.</p>
</div>

<p>For convenience the first is called a <i>Phonic Series</i>; the second is
called a <i>Word List</i>.</p>


<p><b>Phonic Series.</b> Combine <i>f</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>s</i>, with <i>at</i> to form this phonic
series. Review the <i>un</i> series of words.</p>

<p>Develop the blend as follows:</p>

<p>(a) Write <i>at</i> on the blackboard and pronounce it. (The children
will recognize the word, having seen it many times in the reading
lessons.)</p>

<p>(b) Select a consonant, <i>r</i> for example, and write it in front of <i>at</i>.</p>

<p>(c) Combine the two elements into a whole word without making
more of a separation than is necessary to explain the blending of the
sounds.</p>

<p>Prefix <i>f</i> and <i>s</i> in the same way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>Write the <i>at</i> and the <i>un</i> series on the blackboard.</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>Children pronounce the words. Cover first one part and then the
other, sounding each element. Review daily, adding new sound elements
as they are taught. As soon as possible refrain from assisting
the children by covering the parts.</p>


<p><b>Word List.</b> Write upon the blackboard in a vertical row the
words beginning with <i>r</i>, from the Primer, pages 5-26. <i>Ex.</i>: <i>Rover</i>,
<i>roll</i>, <i>rock</i>. Have the children pronounce them. Then erase <i>over</i>,
<i>oll</i>, <i>ock</i>, leaving only <i>r</i>, and let children make the sound. Continue
with words beginning with <i>f</i> and <i>s</i> in the same way.</p>

<p>Again, write several words on the blackboard containing the
phonogram <i>at</i>. Erase <i>f</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>r</i>, leaving only <i>at</i>.</p>

<p>Continue in the same way with the <i>un</i> series and the <i>ing</i> series.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Retain this list on the blackboard for daily drill, rearranging the
order from time to time and adding new words as they are taught.
The lists for word drill are not final. Let use be the guide in deciding
the number of words to be taught. The analysis of these words
into their sound elements will determine the number of phonograms
to be taught. Proper drill upon both the phonic series and the
word lists leads to sight recognition of words, by means of their
sound elements. This is the purpose of phonic work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>


<p><b>Phonic Cards.</b> All drill work should train the mind to observe
accurately, to image vividly, and to express quickly. In every exercise
aim to secure, first, clear images; second, rapid work. It
interferes with normal growth and development to reverse this order.
To accomplish these ends, prepare a set of phonic cards each one
representing a separate sound or phonogram, and use for rapid sight
work after the board work has been given. Cut cards to a uniform
size of eight by six inches, out of heavy paper, and write with India
ink and a camel's hair brush. Stand in front of the class and call
upon the children in order. If the child cannot give the sound instantly,
call upon another. Children will work rapidly if they are
trained to do so. Review frequently and as the need arises prepare
new cards. It is quite possible to have repetition with a constant
variety of new material.</p>


<p class="center">V.</p>

<p class="center"><i><b>h op.</b></i></p>

<p>1. Write <i>hop</i> on the blackboard and teach the sound elements
<i>h</i> and <i>op</i>.</p>

<p>2. Associate each sound with its symbol.</p>

<p>3. Identify the sound <i>h</i> in the sight words <i>have</i>, <i>has</i>, <i>here</i>, <i>hill</i>.
(Proceed as in Lesson IV.)</p>

<p>4. Add <i>hop</i> to Word List No. 1, and review daily, for a few
moments, at the close of each lesson.</p>


<p class="center">VI.</p>

<p class="center"><i><b>j.</b></i></p>

<p>1. Separate the sight words <i>Jack</i>, <i>Jill</i>, <i>jump</i>, into their sound

<p><b>Directions</b>. 1. In the Primer, the First Reader, and the Second
Reader, the words of the vocabulary are arranged in the order in
which they first occur, and are grouped by pages in a word list
placed in the back of the book. Since teachers usually write unfamiliar
words upon the blackboard and develop them in a word
drill preceding the reading lesson, it has not been thought necessary
to place the new words at the beginning of each lesson.
(See Spelling, page 17. Also Word Drill, page 19.)</p>

<p>2. If necessary precede a lesson in the First Reader with a
development lesson on the blackboard. (See page 39, Part II,
Lesson XXI.)</p>

<p>3. A Supplementary List of Poems is given to be read in connection
with the lessons in the First Reader. Do not ask children
to retell the poems read aloud. To develop an appreciation of
poetry is the object. Children who have been accustomed to hearing
poetry will read and enjoy the poems in their readers as much
as the stories. The teacher's attitude toward poetry is the suggestion
that influences.</p>

<span class="small center">(Time, about twenty weeks.)</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>Directions.</b> 1. In Phonic Lessons, First Half Year, Second
Step, the child learned the consonant sounds and some of the common
phonograms. In the second half year phonograms are analyzed
for the purpose of recognizing the vowel sounds as elements.
There are twenty elementary vowel sounds. The purpose of
the phonic lessons is to associate these vowels with the symbols
representing them. See page 113 for a scientific arrangement of the
vowel sounds.</p>


<p class="center">I.</p>

<p class="center"><i>a</i> (short).</p>

<p>1. Separate <i>at</i> into the sound elements <i>a</i> and <i>t</i>. (Give the
sound, not the name.)</p>

<p>2. Associate the sound with the letter.</p>

<p>3. Combine <i>a</i> (short) with the consonants <i>n</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>d</i>, to form
the phonograms <i>an</i>, <i>am</i>, <i>at</i>, <i>ap</i>, <i>ad</i>.</p>

<p>4. Analyze short words containing the sound of <i>a</i> (short) into
phonic elements. (A knowledge of the elementary sounds is the
foundation upon which rests the power to recognize new words.)</p>

<p>5. Analyze the following words, making prominent <i>a</i> (short):
<i>rat</i>, <i>Sam</i>, <i>pat</i>, <i>had</i>, <i>sat</i>, <i>thank</i>, <i>sang</i>, <i>ash</i>, <i>splash</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>


<p class="center">II.</p>

<p class="center"><i>a</i> (long).</p>

<p>Final <i>e</i> causes the preceding vowel to take its <i>name</i> instead of its
<i>sound</i>. Do not teach the rule, but its application. No diacritical
marks are necessary to indicate the short and long vowel sounds.
(Children quickly discover that the final <i>e</i> changes the preceding
vowel from the sound to the name. This is true of almost all words.
When there is a phonetic exception it should be taught as a sight
word.)</p>

<p>1. Write <i>at</i> on the blackboard and have it pronounced. Write
<i>ate</i> beside it and have it pronounced. (The teacher may do this first
and have the children learn the force of <i>e</i> by observation and imitation.)
<i>Ex.</i>: <i>at ate</i>.</p>

<p>2. Combine different consonants and phonograms to illustrate
this principle.</p>

<p class="center">SUMMARY.</p>

<p><b>Phonic Lessons.</b> Third Step contains:</p>

<p>1. 17 vowel sounds:</p>

<p>
a, e, i, o, u (short)<br>
a, e, i, o, u (long)<br>
oo (short), oo (long), a (r), (Italian)<br>
aw, ow, oy, ur.<br>
</p>

<p>2. Nine of these sounds have fifteen common equivalent symbols,
making a total of thirty-two vowel symbols. (See Table of Vowel
Sounds, page 113.)</p>

<p>The three vowel sounds heard in <i>ask</i>, <i>air</i>, and <i>ore</i> may be
omitted. Teach as sight words those used in the Summers
Readers; or if preferred, give a series drill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>Two of these sounds have equivalent spellings.</p>

<p>
<i>air</i> in <i>chair</i>, <i>care</i>, <i>wear</i>.<br>
<i>ore</i> as in <i>more</i>, <i>four</i>, <i>floor</i>, <i>torn</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>The sound <i>ask</i> has the simple spelling <i>a</i>. In this Manual <i>a</i> is
the symbol for <i>a</i> (short) as in <i>at</i> unless changed by some modifier
as <i>final</i>, <i>r</i>, or another vowel. Ex.: <i>at</i>, <i>aw</i>, <i>oa</i>, <i>ea</i>.</p>

<p><b>Directions.</b> 1. In the third half-year initial and final syllables are
taught as phonograms. This enables the child to read words requiring
an understanding of syllabication.</p>

<p>2. The familiar consonant and vowel sounds previously learned
are constantly reviewed in the word lists given for phonic drill.
These are based largely upon the words used in the Primer, the
First Reader, and the Second Reader. The list may be increased
by using, in connection with familiar words, the prefixes and suffixes
given in the following lessons.</p>

<p>3. New sight words which the child may meet in any reader
should be told him.</p>

<p>After the third half year any series of readers may be used. The
literature of childhood, carefully selected and edited, should form the
subject-matter of these reading books.</p>

<p>Phonic lessons based as far as possible upon the words found in
the readers should be practised daily during the first three years.
This later work does not differ from that of the preceding phonic
lessons.</p>

<p>Three vowel sounds may be omitted from the phonic work
in the primary grades. The sounds in <i>ask</i>, <i>fair</i>, and <i>more</i> should
be used with accuracy by the teacher, since the child is at the most
imitative and impressionable stage. In the early phonic work it
will confuse the child if he is taught two sounds for the same symbol.
In this Manual the symbol <i>a</i> means invariably <i>a</i> (short) as in
<i>cat</i>, therefore such words as <i>ask</i>, <i>chance</i>, <i>after</i> are taught through
the series idea. <i>Fair</i>, <i>hair</i>, <i>bore</i>, <i>more</i> are taught in the same
manner.</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
